<h1>Have a Budget</h1>

<p>Many people don’t budget because they don’t want to go through what they think will be a boring process of listing out expenses, adding up numbers, and making sure everything lines up. If you’re bad with money, you don’t have room for excuses with budgeting. If all it takes to get your spending on track is a few hours working a budget each month, why wouldn’t you do it? Plus, you can use several tools to make the process as easy as possible—maybe even fun.</p>
