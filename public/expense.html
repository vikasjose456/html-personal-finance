<h1>Track your expenses</h1>

<p>When it comes to budgeting, sitting down and doing the actual budget is only the first step. You also have to track your expenses.</p>

<p>Because if you just put some numbers down but never actually track your spending throughout the month, how will you know if you’re where you need to be? You won’t. You’ll just end up with an overdrafted bank account (which is the financial version of a charley horse).</p>

<p>The easiest way to track your expenses is with EveryDollar. You can even connect to your bank account so your transactions stream right into your budget. Then all you have to do is drag and drop. Boom! Tracking done.</p>
